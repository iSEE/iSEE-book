## Overview

Panels are defined as a hierarchy of S4 classes.

- DotPlot
  - ColumnDotPlot
    - RedDimPlot
    - ColDataPlot
    - FeatAssayPlot
  - RowDotPlot
    - RowDataPlot
    - SampAssayPlot

The app memory is a list of instances of those classes.

## The panel API

### .cacheCommonInfo

Each panel defines a `.cacheCommonInfo` function.

This function is called for each panel in memory when the app is initialized.
It allows the app to efficienly compute a single time common information that only depends on the input `se` object and will be frequently reused during the runtime of the app.

For instance, the `RedDimPlot` panel type caches the available reduced dimension names available in the `se` object.

### .refineParameters

Each panel defines a `.refineParameters` function.
