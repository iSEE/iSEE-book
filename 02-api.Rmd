# The panel API {#api}

## .cacheCommonInfo

Each individual panel type (e.g., _Reduced dimension plot_) and family of panel types (e.g., _Column dot plot_) defines a `.cacheCommonInfo` function.

This function is called for each panel instance in memory when the app is initialized.
It allows the app to efficiently compute a single time common information that only depends on the input `se` object, and may be frequently reused during the runtime of an app.

Following the hierarchy of panel types, each call to the signature takes a panel instance `x` and the `se` object, and caches common information relevant to all instances of that panel type in the `se` object itself, before calling `callNextMethod()` to invoke the next parent signature.

The top-most signature - for the `Panel` class - returns the `se` object that contains all the cached information.

Note that this function only populates the cache for the first panel of each type; it is a no-op if the common cache has already been initialized.

## .refineParameters

Each individual panel type (e.g., _Reduced dimension plot_) and family of panel types (e.g., _Column dot plot_) defines a `.refineParameters` function.

This function is called for each panel instance in memory when the app is initialized, and also when a new panel is added to the GUI.
It inspects the parameters of a given panel instance, and replaces invalid parameters with sensible values for a given `se` object.

Following the hierarchy of panel types, each call to the signature takes an instance `x` and the `se` object, and first calls `callNextMethod()` to invoke the next parent signature, to refine generic parameters before processing specific ones.

The called signature ultimately returns the updated instance panel `x`, or `NULL` if the panel instance is not available for this app.
