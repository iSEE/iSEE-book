## The app memory

The app `memory` is a list of instances of those classes, which keeps track of the order in which individual panels are displayed in the GUI.

## The panel API

### .cacheCommonInfo

Each individual panel (e.g., _RedDimPlot_) and family of panels (e.g., _ColDotPlot_) defines a `.cacheCommonInfo` function.

This function is called for each panel instance in memory when the app is initialized.
It allows the app to efficienly compute a single time common information that only depends on the input `se` object, and may be frequently reused during the runtime of the app.

Following the hierarchy of panel types, each call to the signature takes a panel instance `x` and the `se` object, and caches the computed information in the `se` object itself, before calling `callNextMethod()` to invoke the next parent signature.

The top-most signature - for the `Panel` class - returns the `se` object that contains all the cached information.

### .refineParameters

Each panel defines a `.refineParameters` function.

This function is called for each panel instance in memory when the app is initialized, and when a new panel is added to the GUI.
