# Panel classes

## Overview

The types of panels available to compose an `r Biocpkg("iSEE")` app are defined as a hierarchy of S4 classes.

<!-- TODO Replace the bullet list below by a figure, like a filesystem tree. -->

- `Panel`
  - `DotPlot`
    - `ColumnDotPlot`
      - `RedDimPlot`
      - `ColDataPlot`
      - `FeatAssayPlot`
    - `RowDotPlot`
      - `RowDataPlot`
      - `SampAssayPlot`
  - `Table`
    - `RowTable`
      - `RowStatTable`
    - `ColumnTable`
      - `ColStatTable`
  - `HeatMapPlot`

## The Panel class

The top-most class is called `Panel`.
It is a virtual class that defines the core properties common to any panel - existing or future - that may be displayed in the interface.

|   |   |
| - | - |
| `PanelId` | Integer index indicating the i^th^ panel of a given type. |
| `PanelHeight` | Height of the panel, in pixels. |
| `PanelWidth` | Width of the panel, an integer value indicating the number of columns to use, from 1 to 12. |
| `SelectBoxOpen` | Logical value indicating if the _Selection parameters_ box of the panel is open when the app starts. |
| `SelectByPlot` | Encoded name of the panel from which to receive a selection of data points. |
| `SelectMultiType` | Keyword indicating the method to deal with multiple incoming selections of data points. |
| `SelectMultiSaved` | Integer index indicating a single data point selection to use, among multiple incoming selections. |

## The DotPlot and Table panel families

The `Panel` virtual class is directly derived into two major virtual sub-classes:

- DotPlot
- Table

Those classes introduce properties that are specific to distinct subsets of panel types.

The `DotPlot` class introduce parameters specific to panels where the output is a `ggplot` object and each row in the data-frame is represented as a point in a plot.

The `Table` class introduce parameters specific to panels where the main output is a data-frame directly displayed as a table in the GUI.

In addition, the `HeatMapPlot` class defines a special panel class that directly extends the `Panel` class, as it introduces a set of parameters distinct from both the `DotPlot` and `Table` panel families.
This panel type is described in further details in a separate section [below](#heatmapplot-class).

## The HeatMapPlot panel class {#heatmapplot-class}

This type of panel introduces parameters specific to panels where the output is a heat map, with each row representing a feature and each column representing a sample in the `se` object.
